<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I’m Fathima Hana — a curious coder, passionate builder, and lifelong
  learner with a soft spot for clean code and creative problem-solving. I hold a
  Master’s degree in Computer Applications from VIT Chennai, and a B.Sc in
  Computer Science, but my love for tech goes far beyond classrooms and
  certificates.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve always been fascinated by how things work — and even more by how they
  <em>could</em> work better. Whether it's detecting defects in metal structures
  using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, predicting sales trends with Python and Linear
  Regression, or building a line-following, obstacle-avoiding robot with
  Arduino, I love diving into problems and coming out with working, thoughtful
  solutions.
</p>

<p>
  Alongside tech, I’ve spent years teaching robotics and programming to students
  from around the world — an experience that taught me patience, clarity, and
  just how rewarding it is to see someone else light up when they “get it.”
</p>

<p>
  I’ve had a few proud moments along the way — winning solo coding competitions,
  scoring top ranks in national entrance exams, and always pushing myself to
  learn more than I knew yesterday. But more than achievements, what drives me
  is the journey of growing — building things that matter, one line of code at a
  time.
</p>

<p>
  Outside the screen, you'll find me exploring self-help books, refining my
  daily habits, or quietly working on becoming just a little better than I was
  the day before.
</p>

<p>
  I’m currently looking for software development opportunities where I can bring
  my skills, creativity, and heart to the table. Let’s build something great.
</p>
