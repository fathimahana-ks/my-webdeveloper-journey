# 🌱 My Web Developer Journey

Hi! I’m Fathima 👋  
An aspiring software developer passionate about bringing ideas to life through code.

This repository is where I’m documenting my journey into web development — one project, one concept, one breakthrough at a time. Whether it’s simple layouts or full-stack experiments, this is my space to learn, build, and grow.

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

- Step-by-step progress as I explore front-end and back-end technologies
- Practice files, mini-projects, and creative experiments
- Code that reflects both what I’ve learned and how I’ve evolved

Everything in this repo is a snapshot of where I am in my journey — not perfect, but always improving.

## 🧰 Technologies I’m Exploring

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Responsive design
- Frameworks and libraries (coming soon)
- Backend tools and databases (also on the way!)
- …and whatever excites me next

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repo is organized in a way that mirrors my learning flow — by topic, project, or concept. I’ve kept the structure simple so it’s easy to navigate and revisit anytime.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I created this to:

- Track my growth as a developer
- Stay consistent and accountable
- Build a public learning journal that reflects my curiosity and progress

## 🌸 A Final Note

This is a journey-in-progress. I’m learning something new every day — breaking things, fixing them, and moving forward. If you stumble upon this repo and find something helpful (or want to say hi), feel free to connect!
